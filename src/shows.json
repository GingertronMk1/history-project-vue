Trousers fall, it is true, but in an instantaneous way as if by divine intervention. Habeas Corpus is a favourite of mine if only because it's one of the few times I've tried to write a naturalistic play...There are plenty of good arts - henpecked husband, frustrated wife, lecherous curate, ubiquitous char - and everyone is slightly larger than life. \"",

The head of the home, Pat Brown, is a feminist alcoholic whose unprofessional manner has drawn her to the attention of the man from the council, Mr Fletcher.\n\nNeeding a witness to testify against Miss Brown, Mr Fletcher turns to Sarah Baker, a devout Christian and wife of Neil. However, Sarah will not testify.\n\nWe also follow the story of Juliette, a young mother who escapes her abusive husband Carl to find sanctuary in the home.\n\nThe story is told in an old style with a new twist. In keeping with the advice of the forefathers of theatre, the action is commented on by a Greek choir. Only this time, they're wearing gospel robes rather than plaster masks.\n\nThe Celestial Fire Gospel Singers were founded for this production. With singers from all over the world the choir have come together to bring this musical onto the stage\n\n\nThe Celestial Fire Gospel Singers were founded for this production.

Five of these are men who are related to each other: Max, a retired butcher; his brother Sam, a chauffeur; and Max's three sons \u2014 Teddy, an expatriate American philosophy professor; Lenny, who appears to be a pimp; and Joey, a would-be boxer in training who works in demolition. There is one woman, Ruth, who is Teddy's wife. The play concerns Teddy's and Ruth's \"homecoming\", which has distinctly different symbolic and thematic implications\n\nAfter having lived in the United States for several years, Teddy brings his wife, Ruth, home for the first time to meet his working-class family in North London, where he grew up and which she finds more familiar than their arid academic life in America.\n\nMuch sexual tension occurs as Ruth teases Teddy's brothers and father and the men taunt one another in a game of oneupmanship, resulting in Ruth's staying behind with Teddy's relatives as \"one of the family\" and Teddy returning home to America and their three sons without her.",

The rest of the play revolves around this birthday meal - through Stephanie and Glyn we see the future, the events following Laura's birthday meal. Through Adam and Maureen we see the past, the events leading up to Laura's birthday meal. IT is both funny and thought-provoking as we watch all the skeletons come tumbling from the closet.",

When Sarah Kane committed suicide in 1999 she too had only lived long enough to produce a relatively small body of work - five plays in total and one short film. The violent circumstances of their authors' deaths is not the only factor that links \"The Ruffian on the Stair\" and \"Crave\". Both plays deal with the theme of death, or more specifically, the desire to no longer exist.",

Her final play, 4.48 Psychosis was performed posthumously folowing her tragic suicide in 1999 and represents the culmination of her quest for new forms of theatre based on viceral personal expereince. A stark experience of the internal world of a clinical depressive on the verge of suicide, 4.48 Psychosis is viewed as aone of the most challenging works to have come out of Britain in the 1990s.",

Based on George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion, it tells the story of Henry Higgins, an arrogant, irascible professor of phonetics who boasts to fellow linguist Colonel Pickering that he can train any woman to speak so properly that he could pass her off as a duchess, including Eliza Doolittle, a poor girl with a decidedly Cockney accent whom he encountered selling flowers in Covent Garden. Pickering is intrigued by Higgins's boast and wagers that he cannot make good on his claim; Higgins takes on the challenge and begins an intensive make-over of Eliza's speech, manners and dress in preparation for her appearance at the Embassy Ball. Complicating matters is Eliza's father Alfred, a cheerfully amoral and drink-loving dustman who shows up, supposedly to save his daughter's virtue, but in reality hoping to extract money from Higgins.\n\nMade famous by the film starring Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison, this is the tale of a girl taken from rags to riches, featuring such classic songs as 'Wouldn't it be loverly', 'On the street where you live' and 'Get me to the church on time'.

The attractive and playful Lizzie, is courted by Rufus, a local youth with a criminal background and a less than encouraging future.

This new, crooked environment tests the limits of Jack\u2019s mental endurance, facing an inner battle of whether to return to the straight and narrow of his previous life, or go through with the new demands placed on him by his criminal superiors.\n\nAn ensemble, devised piece being led by artistic director Simon Thompson (see award-winning \u2018Slippery Soapbox\u2019) and produced by NT Treasurer Jackie Lee.\n\nThe Die Is Cast...",

The attractive and playful Lizzie, is courted by Rufus, a local youth with a criminal background and a less than encouraging future. Feeling the duty to protect his sister and his family name, Jack is forced to defend his sister, bringing him into a world completely different from his own. This new, crooked environment tests the limits of Jack\u2019s mental endurance, facing an inner battle of whether to return to the straight and narrow of his previous life, or go through with the new demands placed on him by his criminal superiors.\n\nAn ensemble, devised piece being led by artistic director Simon Thompson (see award-winning \u2018Slippery Soapbox\u2019) and produced by NT Treasurer Jackie Lee.\n\nThe Die Is Cast\u2026",

There are three main plots, all of which overlap and inter-relate.  Arthur Wicksteed, trusted medical practitioner, is tempted by a young lady that walks into his surgery one afternoon.  By chance she meets the Doctor\u2019s hypochondriac son, Dennis, during her visit and learns that he is terminally ill with Brett\u2019s Palsy.  This is the answer to her dreams as the honourable Felicity Rumpers is with child out of wedlock, a heinous crime, even in those promiscuous times.  Three months of marriage before Dennis deceases will give her respectability and a \u2018legitimate\u2019 father nine months later; but all is not as in seems in this hilarious comedy about love, sex and mopeds\u2026",

His tale takes them to the Holy Land 30 years previously, amidst the horror of the First Crusade, where the man and his friend were spared a hanging upon agreeing to cross into enemy territory and retrieve an artefact behind which an army could take Jerusalem. As the story unfolds the landlady is forced to examine her life and reflect upon her inadequacies as well as the need for redemption that she has only a swearing, thieving, whoring, boozing old outlaw to help her find. Deus Vult is not a historical play; it is a modern play about relatable people struggling with the timeless issues of fear, loyalty and morality. Above all it is about humanity's never-ending struggle to seek a glimmer of light in a world of filth and emptiness.\n\nDeus Vult promises to be a moving and powerful performance from a new piece of student-brewed writing.",

Matthew Shepard's abduction by two of the local boys created a media firestorm that spanned the globe, and inspired a generation to fight against intolerance.\n\nThe Laramie Project tells the story of the residents of this sleepy city in the American Midwest. In a town defined by an accident, a crime, it explores how it's residents feel, their reactions, and perhaps most importantly, are they to be blamed?\n\nVerbatim theatre, innovative story telling and multirolling like you've never seen it before, The Laramie Project is one of the most performed plays in America and considered by many to be one of the 10 best american plays of the 90's.\n\nJournalistic. Emotional. Frank. Unbiased. Astonishing.",

Forced to go to the home by her mother, Mary along with the other girls, has to cope with the shame of her situation and the dawning realisation that her baby will be taken away and given up for adoption whether she likes it or not. Despite the hard hitting nature of the play, the youthfulness and positive spirit of the girls is echoed in the 1960s girl-group music which they sing along to.\n\nInspired by the real accounts and heart-breaking memories from the women Amanda Whittington interviewed, Be My Baby provides for us a glimpse into a part of our shockingly recent social history that for too long was shut away and \u2018forgotten\u2019.",

The modern world interweaves with the traditional fairytale creating a ghostly parallel of Alice\u2019s experience. Be entertained by a play which harnesses an original style \u2013 including ensemble sequences, singing and stylised characterisations \u2013 and will move you and make you laugh as we discover that reality does not always guarantee happy endings.",

In secret, they meet with the enemy women and form a pact. The battle moves into the bedroom. No sex for the men - unless the women get peace. Lysistrata is the original battle of the sexes and its themes of feminism, power and politics are as relevant now as they were in ancient Greece.\n\nLakeside and The Nottingham New Theatre are thrilled to be working on a first collaborative theatre project, marrying the talents of the University\u2019s student-run theatre company with a professional team including direction, design, stage management, education and marketing. This project has been funded by Cascade: a grants programme supported by donations from the University of Nottingham's alumni and friends",

By reversing the chronological order of events, Pinter does not evoke questions relating to when events took place, but rather how and why. In a play where the network of relations is finely crafted: Pinter juggles around his three characters in all possible arrangements of the bitter triangle, each betrayer becoming, in turn, the betrayed.",

He is also doomed by his own hubris, greed and ambition. Bored of logic and mundane life, he makes a pact with the devil: 24 years of unimaginable power in return for his own damnation into hell. One of the original and greatest morality stories, with plenty of laughs along the way. Doctor Faustus and its themes of power and corruption are as relevant today as they were in 1604.",

Through a psychiatrist's analysis of the events, Shaffer creates a chilling portrait of how materialism and convenience have killed our capacity for worship and passion and, consequently, our capacity for pain. Rarely has a playwright created an atmosphere and situation that so harshly pinpoints the spiritual and mental decay of modern man. With passionate monologue combined with a thrilling exploration of physicality, Equus is a play not to be missed.",

Shakespeare's immortal tragedy of star-crossed lovers and warring families us brought to life at The Nottingham New Theatre in all its vibrant and visceral glory. Featuring Shakespeare\u2019s most beautiful romantic poetry, his rudest bawdy and a host of iconic characters and scenes.",

Legendary Roman General, Titus Andronicus, returns home to Rome with the defeated Queen of the Goths, Tamora, her sons and lover as captives. When he sacrifices her eldest son she vows to exact painful revenge over Titus and his family. Whilst arguably Shakespeare's rawest and darkest play, it remains as poignant and poetical as some of his greatest works.",

Now they reunite to build a vessel in his memory and to confront their past in the way they did as children in Ireland - by telling stories, acting them out and disagreeing violently at every turn. Through fast-paced comedy, inventive physical storytelling and an evocative original score, Vessel looks at the pain and the joy of growing up and celebrates it all in the imaginative spirit of childhood play. Fine Frenzy Theatre is a new company formed by recent Nottingham University alumni. Fine Frenzy's aim is to purposefully and decisively seek out new and illuminating ways in which to tell stories through theatre.",

As more explosions tear their beloved hometown apart, tensions rise in the town as a vigilante state of mind takes hold, and for the lads, who began the weekend with such bravado, things are about to come to a violent end.",

But as his niece begins to fall for one of them, it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s not just, as Eddie claims, that he\u2019s too strange, too effeminate, too careless for her, but that something bigger, deeper is wrong, wrong inside Eddie, in a way that he can\u2019t face.

Isobel, Thomas, and Tony are each scrambling to save their jobs with one destined for the sack from their daunting boss Carter. Surely his decision will be fair? Don\u2019t be so sure. Two colleagues lie, cheat, taunt and victimise their way to success in order to make the other see red. This play is a stark and brutal look at bullying in the workplace which is guaranteed to hit you hard like a shot of tequila and make you squirm uncomfortably in your seat.",

As Charlie\u2019s IQ begins to rise he grows both mentally and emotionally but his growth is unsustainable and before too long, he becomes more isolated than he ever was before.

Ionesco (one of the most prominent avant-garde writers within \u2018The Theatre of the Absurd\u2019) wrote Macbett as a fond parody of Macbeth. Ionesco is not mocking Shakespeare, he is satirising war and government in this profoundly funny and profane depiction of human nature.",

With the city in pandemonium, the theatre in ruin and the Master missing, Margarita calls on the Devil\u2019s assistance. By cleverly interweaving several plot lines including extracts from the Master\u2019s play set in biblical Jerusalem, senses of fear and dark humour are blended seamlessly together in this magical tale.",

While at first the three display their national biases and prejudices, their resentments and recriminations give way to an acknowledgment of each others\u2019 characters, strengths, and weaknesses. As they learn that humour is their surest weapon against their demise, they must walk the delicate tightrope between keeping each other alive, and destroying each others\u2019 sanity. Through imaginary films, throwing big parties for each other, and fantastical games of tennis, they learn to lament what was lost in their lives before captivity, and hope to achieve their ultimate goal - survival.",

This show has been praised by both its contemporary and modern critics, and with its mix of high farce and witty dialogue, it\u2019s become one of the most loved and enduring plays from the Victorian era. Earnest satires the views of mortality of the time, as well as the views of marriage, which should be a serious institution, and about what is in the end most important; being Ernest or to be Earnest.",

Antonio and Sebastian conspire to kill Alonso and Gonzalo, whilst elsewhere Caliban, Prospero\u2019s slave monster, plots with Stephano (the drunken butler) and Trinculo (the mischevous court jester) to kill Prospero.

Tyrannosaurus Sketch sets out a smorgasbord of comedy, from highbrow humour to cringe-worthy puns, with pit-stops at superhero parodies and absolute absurdism, this show is sure to entertain, as these Nottingham students come out all puns blazing!",

Written as a sequel to his coming of age play East, West is set against a backdrop of sex, violence, the Kray Twins and fish cakes. As his story progresses, we see Mike and his gang tell their tale through high-energy physical theatre and comedy, as Mike\u2019s girlfriend and parents continually question his actions. At it\u2019s heart, West is a play about courage, and whether it\u2019s worth it to pursue desires at the risk of alienation.",

The solution: to exile under pain of death the rightful heir to the Dukedom, her own niece and the people\u2019s favourite, Rosalind. Meanwhile Orlando finds himself the victim of a cruel and archaic hereditary system exposing him to the fatal plots and ploys of his elder brother, Oliver. Fleeing their homes, the company including a fool, a servant and Frederica\u2019s daughter Celia, escape into the Forest of Arden along with the hero and heroine in search of the rightful Duchess. What they discover however, is a place where freedom of expression and playfulness can, for the first time, triumph over the social constraints and expectations of \u2018the envious court.\u2019",

Gregg lives with his slovenly roommate Steve, a layabout. As time goes on, more and more roommates move in - the bubbly and upbeat Lucy and the charismatic and commanding John - each more unusual than the last. This pushes the limits of Gregg\u2019s friendships, and his patience. It is in the interactions between this strange group of characters and Gregg where we see what depression really does to people, often without anyone realising. The Black Dog on my Sofa is a punchy, funny, and eye-opening play, allowing us to tackle a topic that affects many of the people around us.",

Miss Blake\n\nIt is 1896 and Tess has begun her education at Girton College, Cambridge \u2013 home to the country\u2019s first female students and an object of contempt and derision for the rest of the university.\n\nUnable to graduate, yet matching their male peers grade for grade, Tess and her fellow students begin to notice their stigma as 'bluestockings' \u2013 unnatural, educated women. Endangered by their position as unqualified and unmarriagable, they must fight to change the history of education.\n\nFacing economic difficulty, the distractions of love and senseless prejudice the women dare to confront outdated social practices in order to live life to the full. Blue Stockings follows the women over one tumultuous academic year, in their fight for the right to graduate.\n\nIn 2017, as new financial barriers to university spring up and the issue of women\u2019s access to education all over the world is rarely off the news, many of the questions the play raises feel as significant and relevant now as ever.",

As the four of them enter and leave relationships with each other, trust is consistently broken with the play examining exactly how love and sex can be used as commodities. \u2018Closer\u2019 ultimately showcases a web of deceit and sexual desire, questions what is really expected of the conventional relationship, and asks whether selfish desire is at the heart of all our actions.",

For ninety years the six neglected spirits sit about wondering what went wrong, until a young woman bursts through the door bringing all the glitz and glamour of the 1980s and throwing their ghoulish existences into chaos. Within a week, the young bachelor gentleman of the ghosts has fallen head over heels for the new tenant who can neither see nor hear him. Meanwhile, his best friend prepares to venture tentatively into the outside world for the first time, and the blustering patriarch of the ghost family struggles to conceal a dangerous secret from his love-starved wife, who is determined to breathe fresh passion into their long lifeless marriage. In an original musical that features everything from dancing mystics to underpaid angels and trips to the afterlife and back, everyone will be shown that it is never too late to begin life again, even if you\u2019re already dead.",

Her performance is an intense reflection on her desire to be watched and liked, but also her temptation to hide from the things that scare her. Jessica is daunted by the experiences that take her into adulthood, slowly realising what her weaknesses are. Abbie is Jessica\u2019s childhood friend, who is understanding of her insecurities. She looks after Jessica as much as she can, but can\u2019t always be there for her. In spite of this, Abbie promises that she will never stop watching over Jessica. Infectious is a playful and moving two-woman audience-interaction show that uses improvisation. It deals with the experiences that connect us all: the stresses of becoming an adult, the long-lasting bonds we form with our loved ones, and how it feels when those bonds are broken.",

They all lead seemingly unrelated lives and yet one by one they gradually come to know each other and develop a connection that even they cannot understand.

With the charismatic Jim Jones as leader, the congregation grew due to his captivating rhetoric of equality and socialism at a time of great social unrest and segregation. Jim appeared to be an answer to their prayers and desires, yet the cult soon realised that the utopia they loved had a dystopian undercurrent waiting to explode. Based upon true events and inspired by archival materials including audio clips and footage, the play explores the rise and fall of the infamous Jim Jones and his cult. This is not a play about the \u2018dangers of religion.\u2019 Its purpose is to educate, remember and humanise the congregation at the People\u2019s Temple, who joined the community as an attempt to escape from the hatred and social injustice they witnessed in a broken, modern America.",

Exhilarating, fast-paced and sharp dialogue drive this play to its radical and ironic climax with audience members invited to break down the barriers between actor and character.

It\u2019s about what you leave behind.\u201d\n\nA writer named Katurian is interrogated by two detectives about his short stories, some of which hold clear similarities to a number of child-murders that are being committed in his town. Set within an unnamed totalitarian state, Katurian is questioned by detectives Tupolski and Ariel who adopt an unconventional dynamic to determine Katurian\u2019s involvement in the atrocities. When the detectives reveal that they have also detained Katurian\u2019s brother Michal, things become more complex and Katurian realises that he may be more culpable than previously thought. Martin McDonagh\u2019s (In Bruges, The Cripple of Inishmaan) black comedy explores the nature of censorship and the responsibility of art in a time when fiction can be considered as dangerous as reality.

She agrees to undergo an experimental chemotherapy treatment that, although not guaranteed to save her, will provide excellent research data for the future of oncology. Over the course of her treatment, she begins to question how she has lived her life, an uncompromising strive for knowledge and intellectual brilliance \u2013 and begins to see the importance of human connection and kindness. Professor Bearing valiantly braves all eight rounds of the chemotherapy, but is told the tumour has not been completely dispelled, and there is nothing else that can be done. Through the agony of dying from a terminal illness, she learns a lesson of compassion. 'W;t' is a poignant and humorous look at life, death, poetry, and openness.",

Loosely based on *The Tempest*, this show is an absurd political satire chronicling two days in the lives of six pirates, and one dead parrot, shipwrecked on a tropical island. These buffoonish buccaneers turn on one another, each vying for power, using different ideologies to manipulate their comrades. This fast-paced comedy explores whether institutions can ever be anything but systems for oppression and whether game theory is an accurate description of political practice.",

The situation becomes worse when Salter\u2019s original son arrives and the huge web of deceit that has been created begins to be torn down. Caryl Churchill\u2019s haunting two hander examines the ethics of science with a new spin on the father\/son relationship.

The metafictional play will discuss the existential problems of reality and free will, and ask questions about the importance and role of an author in their piece of work. In this devised farce actors will be given the unique and exciting challenge of exploring and creating their own versions of some of literature\u2019s most famous and beloved characters.",

By examining the way in which audiences react and interact with the performance, we gain insight into the relationship between actor and character in order to break down our notion of theatre as a passive viewing experience. All of us have experienced, or will experience, loss at some point in our lives, and this play looks at the way in which this has an impact on every aspect of our life. Ultimately, this piece portrays a truthful relationship and an optimistic and life-affirming story - just not in the most obvious or conventional way.",

He takes his position seriously and will not be distracted by such foolishness.

Why can he barely look his baby daughter in the eye, or even acknowledge her existence? Will Franz and Marie ever be able to be truly happy again? Loosely based on Georg Buchner\u2019s incomplete 19th century German classic Woyzeck, this modern adaptation focuses on remembering victims of war, and questioning how it is we remember them, exploring this through physical theatre.",

In secret they meet with the enemy women and form a pact. The battle moves into the bedroom. No sex for the men unless the women get peace. First performed in 411 BC, this bawdy anti-war play remains one of the great comedies. Layered with themes of feminism, power and politics, we\u2019re thrilled to present this contemporary adaptation in our sixth partnership with Nottingham New Theatre.",

When the Greek hero Jason arrives at Colchis, the princess Medea falls passionately in love with him and helps him steal the Golden Fleece. As a result, she is cast out of her kingdom and forced to raise their children in exile. However several years later, Medea is betrayed. After seeking refuge at Corinth, Jason has fallen for the princess Creusa, daughter of King Creon. Refusing to passively be cast aside for a younger woman, Medea plans her revenge on Jason. Revenge that once unleashed will destroy everything Jason holds dear. The play deals with the themes of motherhood, gender identity, immigration, divorce and adultery; proving how Medea is as relevant today as it was in Ancient Greece.",

Richard Bean's uproarious farce, that has received stellar commendation on the West End and Broadway, follows the heart-warmingly disastrous character of Francis Henshall, who accidentally finds himself simultaneously employed by a local gangster and an eccentric upper-class murderer who share an unfortunately complicated past, landing Francis in the middle of a choreographed chaos of slapstick comedy and highly physicalised interactions, we also witness his constant crusade to conquer both his gastronomic and flirtatious desires. He encounters characters ranging in intellect and theatrical flair that both hinder and facilitate his efforts to keep both of his guvnors apart.",

Aaron has started to lose his personality. Aaron has started to stop being Aaron. He doesn\u2019t know what is happening. No one knows what is happening; not his sister or mother, his best friend at university, nor neuroscience researchers. However, as Aaron\u2019s memory fades the other people in his life begin to recall things, trying desperately to make sense of what is happening to him. \n\nThis play is an unflinching look at how under-discussed medical conditions can impact not just the patient but also those around them.",

Anna hasn\u2019t left her flat for two years, refuses to eat solid food and is tearing up her apartment piece by piece. Rebecca has spiralled into a cycle of rage, despair, sadness and anger she cannot control in the wake of ending a long-term relationship. Sam is discovering his new identity in a world of violence and discrimination, that is preventing him from becoming his true authentic self. When these three strangers come into contact with each other, their lives are changed forever. Passionate, complex, furious and funny, Swallow promises to be an emotional and visceral experience. One that explores the difficulties of surviving in the modern world, exposes us to the darkest corners of our minds, but reinforces the power we have to overcome even our darkest and most vulnerable moments.",

She doesn\u2019t want to wear skirts or makeup and adjust herself to conform to obligatory femininity within society. It takes us through a journey of her life from being a young girl into an adult. It revolves around the ideas and implications of the entrenched social constructions that have been imposed on gender identity and focuses on expectations of men and women within society. The play explores both her vulnerability and her strength in being ostracized in such a society where being masculine is solely confined to males. The play focuses on difficult and thought provoking topics but is accompanied by the character\u2019s quick wit and inspiring strength in her sense of self.",

Their only solace is imaginary friend, Benji, who provides a constant source of company and comfort in their darkest times. However, Benji is not the positive force that she first appears, and slowly turns into something more sinister. Using poetry, projection and live sound looping, this powerful yet surprisingly uplifting monologue explores loneliness, recovery and the universal need for love.",

Moved from the Smalltown Department of Facial Equality, Stuart receives a command from \"the Big Boss\"... He is to help beat the Communists in the race to landing men on the Moon.

Maureen\u2019s sisters have fled their toxic home and left her single-handedly responsible to care for her mother, a thorny and abusive woman who controls Maureen\u2019s life and denies others from offering her the one thing she seeks from life, a genuine human connection. Then Pato, the village charmer, enters Maureen\u2019s life and offers her opportunities beyond the limited scope of her Irish home, disrupting Mag\u2019s carefully maintained status quo, which sets in motion a tragic train of events. Looking at family bonds and the effects of abuse on the human psyche, yet handled with surprising humour, McDonagh\u2019s darkly comic domestic piece is laced with hubris and sympathy, violence and tenderness, youth and tradition.",

But unbeknownst to Faustus, chaos and evil have been carefully placed between the pages and a tempest of devils have set their sights on his soul. And in the midst of this madness where is God? Why will they not save Faustus? Only one thing is for sure, damnation awaits you, Faustus. In this abstract adaptation, Marlowe\u2019s classic play is deconstructed and reassembled with scenes from other versions of the tale.",

Years later, he begins to unpack it all, slowly learning the fragmentary nature of memories and the danger they can pose in the present. The impact this has on his life creates a difficult question: Are some things better left buried? Or is the truth worth seeking, no matter how terrible it might be? 'Esse SA Essay' is a play about masculinity, rape, and memories. In today\u2019s culture of sexual assault scandals, toxic masculinity, and the importance of personal image, this is a discussion that needs to be held.",

How complicated can it be?\n\nWomen and men are equal in today\u2019s society yet there are hundreds of gender biased choices that we make every day, stereotypes that we choose to conform to, double standards that we see as the norm and embrace. Society still looks down on stay-at-home dads, over-sexualisation of women is on the rise, the groom always says his wedding vows first, and heels are reserved for women and drag queens.\n\nThrough exploring the extremes of gendered power dynamics and heteronormative behaviour the question we seek to answer is; why do individuals in modern society choose traditional gender roles when the world around them is full of equality and empowerment?",

By compiling the history of Luca\u2019s private messages and online presence, she is able to make Dot fall in love with him all over again.

Grant desperately wants to live, and an overworked Death wants their lunch break. So a deal is struck, Grant and Death use Grant\u2019s (last?) 90 minutes going back through Grant\u2019s memories to decide whether he deserves to live or die. Darkly comedic and slightly surreal, 'Grant Meets Death' explores through montages, music and a literal trolley problem, the question of what each individual life is worth. Through a rollercoaster of both heart-warming and painful memories, this new piece of theatre explores a life from beginning to end and attempts to reassure us all that every life is unique, even if we all meet Death in the end.",

Directed by Jerome Curtis, a \u201cvisionary\u201d new voice in English theatre, Nothing to See Here stars Emily Ashford (Memento Mori) and Violet Burrows (Live, Laugh, Lose), as well as legendary Hollywood \u201ccreature creator\u201d Jackson Ocelot (Bigfoot Blues, Midnight Mississippi, The Thing from Next Door).\n\nNothing to See Here follows Ray Roberts (Ashford) and Rachel Penderghast (Burrows) as they investigate the string of robberies plaguing their city and find themselves drawn into the increasingly strange events surrounding the opening of the new Doctor Nottingham Memorial Genetics Laboratory. A shocking, engaging and endearing show, which asks what we value more: our history, or our future?\n\nAs a member of the press, you are invited to an advance, matinee showing of the performance, as well as a brief Q&A with the show\u2019s crew.

The fate of our beloved country rests on your shoulders! So, what do you intend to do about it? Solve the mystery, crack the code and save the day hurrah! Fail to complete the tasks and you fail to escape.\" Three people wake up in a room with no memory of who they are, where they are or how they arrived there. All they know is that they have to escape. The game leads them on moments of introspection that they would rather not face. Loosely based on Sartre\u2019s 'In Camera' or 'No Exit', 'The Escape Room' explores existentialist ideas and the self in relation to society.",

Left to fend for themselves and to care for their dog Taliban, the two brothers spend their time playing PlayStation, streaming porn and watching the world go by. Occasionally their mum Maggie visits, usually with empty pockets and empty promises. Then Jenny shows up.

Tackling the relationship between nature and nurture, Jordan shocks audiences into questioning whether or not we have autonomy over the choices we make.

        "body": "## A note from the editors\n> During the Covid-19 global pandemic in Spring 2020, the majority of the Spring productions were cancelled. Although we do not typically archive cancelled productions, it would be inaccurate to present an archive without recognising almost a whole season that was lost and the contributions that cast and crews were making up till the last moment they could.\n\n## 'The Darling Heidi Howard' by Alice Brooker (22nd-24th March, Fringe)\nAfter witnessing her parents tumultuous divorce, and her mother\u2019s advice to never fall into the trap of marriage, Heidi Howard journeys through her adolescence vowing to never risk the same fate in love. She forces herself to grow-up, and shut herself off from emotional relationships. She then meets Artie, a boy who challenges her outlook, and agrees to be his friend. After receiving advice and hearing stories from her friend Kiki and her Aunt Florence, as well as facing conflict with Artie, Heidi comes to an unexpected conclusion about herself and how she should live her life when it comes to love.\n\n## 'Reverie' by Francis Simmons (29th-30th March, Fringe)\nIn the far future, on a base deep beneath the Atlantic Ocean, a mysterious creature has broken on board and picked off the crew one by one. The two surviving crew members want nothing more than to escape, but have lost all contact with the outside world. Running low on power and supplies, all that can help them is the base\u2019s malfunctioning computer - which has started talking to them. Their situation is only worsened by the presence of a strange woman promising the destruction of all mankind. Worst of all, neither of the survivors can be sure if anything around them is real, or simply their steady descent into insanity...\n\n## 'The Pros and Cons of an Overactive Imagination' by Cecilia Alexander (4th-5th May, Fringe)\nMaggie spends her nights dreaming and her days... also dreaming. Caught up in her own imaginations, she doesn\u2019t realise how it affects her because who better to talk to than yourself, right? Despite family, friends and more being worried for her, there is nothing Maggie wants more than to entertain herself, and now you too.\n\n## 'Shades' by Chiara Crompton (10th-12th May, Fringe)\nTwo figures stand alone in the room of a dead man, a year on from his death. It\u2019s been too long and not long enough. Time trips around in circles as the two linger in fragmented memories and sensations, drifting further from each other with each convolution. The long shadow that is cast obscures light, leaving each estranged from any identity existing beyond the room, their memories or him.\n\nThis experimental short play explores the murky shade left by grief and loss. It looks at its ability to corrode our perceptions of relationships, the self and even our sense of reality.",

Although we do not typically archive cancelled productions, it would be inaccurate to present an archive without recognising almost a whole season that was lost and the contributions that cast and crews were making up till the last moment they could.\n\n## 'Trojan Women' by Euripides (In House)\nTrojan Women takes us to the ruins of the city of Troy, in the aftermath of the Greek victory in the Trojan War. The grieving Trojan widows face the prospect of slavery, and are at the mercy of the Greek leaders who are striving to fulfil a horrific prophecy in order to return home.\nThis Roman play focuses on the complexity of Trojan female stories not found in Homer\u2019s Greek-male-centric epic. Based on Euripides\u2019 Greek play of the same name, and written during the controversial and tumultuous period of Emperor Nero\u2019s reign, Seneca creates a powerful and moving version of this myth, pervaded by the sinister world that he saw around him. An abstract interpretation of a script that may never have been intended for performance, Trojan Women demonstrates the universality of the consequences of war and how complex female emotion should be presented on stage, no matter the era.\n\n## 'Pink Mist' by Owen Shears (25th-28th March, In House)\n\u201cThree boys went to Catterick. It was January, snow pitchen on the Severn, turning the brown mud white, fisherman blowing on their fingerless gloves, the current pulling their fishing lines tight. That\u2019s how it was the morning when the three of us did what boys always have and left our homes for war.\u201d Pink Mist follows each boy\u2019s experience both during and after their tours to Afghanistan. Within a short period of time each return to the important women in their lives - a wife, a mother, a girlfriend - and shows how everyone must now share the psychological and physical aftershocks of their service.\n\n## 'Be My Baby' by Amanda Whittington (31st March - 3rd April, In House)\nSet in St Saviours, a Mother and Baby Home in 1964 in the north of England, the play follows Mary Adams, aged 19, unmarried and seven months pregnant. Forcibly sent there by her deeply ashamed mother, Mary \u2013 along with the other girls in the home \u2013 has to cope both with the shame and the dawning realisation that they may not be able to take their babies home, whether they like it or not.\nDespite this, and an overbearing matron, the girls\u2019 youthful effervescence breaks through, as they sing along to the girl-group songs of the period.\n\n## 'POSH' by Laura Wade (6th-9th May, In House)\nNine members of an elite Oxford dining society with cut-glass vowels and deep pockets are meeting, intent on restoring their right to rule. Portrayed by female actors, these nine men embark on an evening of debauchery, decadence and bloody good wine - testing the limits of how far money can take you, and whether or not it can save you. Welcome to the Riot Club. The play begins with the rebirth of the Club after being exposed and shamed in the media. It follows the nine existing members through an evening of fine dining in a modest pub in the middle of England, through to an accident which could land them behind bars \u2013 far away from the comfort of their Oxford colleges.\n\n## 'Wasted' by Kae Tempest (13th-16th May, In House)\nThree old friends. One remarkable day. For Ted, Danny, and Charlotte, it\u2019s time to take control. Make a difference. Change things. A journey through the parks, raves, and cafes of London, where life is what you make it. This is a play about love, life, and losing your mind. Kae Tempest\u2019s fast paced dialogue integrates choral spoken-word poetry into the plot creating a vibrant and exciting play which explores the effects of drugs, death, and dreams on a group of childhood friends.",

Sensitive and unfit for the role,\nhe soon realises one great boon to his situation: he now has the power to repeal the exile of his\nlover, Piers Gaveston, and return him to his side.\nAn emotionally fuelled tale of love, longing and despair, Edward II is a play that explores how people\nunder immense pressure can become the most extreme versions of themselves. This new\ninterpretation of Marlowe\u2019s classic play places the events in a neon, dream-like world inspired by\n80\u2019s night life.",

Why can he barely look his baby daughter in the eye, or even acknowledge her existence? And who exactly is the mysterious Drummer getting in the way of Franz's happiness? Loosely based on Georg Buchner's incomplete 19th century German classic 'Woyzeck', this modern adaptation focusses on how we remember victims of war, and how easy it is to fail them.",

William Shakespeare\u2019s classic text of corruption and unrest takes on a whole new light as we see a fickle public, a newscast filled with war and destruction, and behind the scenes in a conspiracy that only perpetuates a cycle of hate it seeks to end.",

The play highlights how the modern generation has an inability to articulate our inner thoughts and feelings, and whether this damages our relationships.\n\nThe play, set entirely in one bedroom, follows the characters of Hen and Lydia, best friends and course mates. Taking place over a series of months, the audience watches snippets from their life. The play moves from scenes of girlish preening, to intimate night-time chats, to jealousy-fuelled arguments. We watch as the girl\u2019s dynamic changes, as their inability to communicate with one another is brought more and more to the surface.\n\nWatch as a female friendship walks along the tightrope of romance.",

In a play about mistakes and misunderstandings, the characters fight with each other and themselves to turn their upset world into a place of peace and love, resulting in a series of plans gone-wrong that put them far out of their depth.\nHilarious, over-the-top and comically disastrous, this is the Shakespeare that you know and love (but with a little bit more neon paint!)",

Set around the University Park Campus, 'Pilgrimage' takes an alternative look at university and explores the benefits and dangers that the freedom afforded by moving out can have on young adults.\n\nWritten in free indirect discourse, 'Pilgrimage' gives an intimate insight into the minds of the characters and combines poetry and drama to explore the hedonism and challenges of first time independence.\n\nHeart warming, dramatic and a little bit existential,'\u2018Pilgrimage' is a piece that encapsulates the university experience in a very unique way.",

The battered and bruised seventeen-year-old boy confesses to Anita that he has been unable to escape Vincent\u2019s ghost. Tonight they meet for the first time... and their lives change forever.\nThrilling, heartbreaking and darkly humorous, Vincent River is a powerful exploration of hate crime and flaws within our society.",

Watch Alex Bradbury tackle modern-day privacy issues in his latest episode of \u2018Brave New World\u2019, as he uncovers the truth about yet another exposed corporate lie. NDAs and Confidentiality Clauses can only hide the truth to an extent, and as Alex ventures deeper into the issue of the new TJE phone update, they discover that all is not as discussed in the media, nor released to the public. What has been framed to be a step forward in personal security and privacy measures for all phone users, reveals a far more suspicious story concerning contracted data protection leaks in collusion with the government.",

In the Easr End of London, a tropical heat fills the air, carrying the scent of reggae, spices and a chance at true love. Whilst tensions between white and black communities are high and the chances of racial harmony seem slim, Lizzie Darcy and Delroy Thompson attempt to defy the odds. Two people, from two very different worlds form an unlikely bond, one that could only be justly described as destiny. However, the imperfect reality of the 60s quickly wipes away the rose-coloured stain on this story and instead poses the question of, this story and instead poses the quesiton of, how does it feel to love someone when the world tells you not to?\n\nA family story, inspired by true events.",

Over the course of an evening, the two women are plunged back through memories of blissful childhood in the Polish People's Republic, breathtaking love, and dreams of the glorious and promising 'West'. What also comes to haunt is guilt and regret, as the ghosts of her father and brother loom large. Dorota stands at a crossroads in her own life and must decide how to acknowledge these regrets, without letting them hold her in their clutches. A winding family tale, meditating on freedom, sacrifice, and the choices we make, featuring the sights and ssounds of a unique time in history",

He just can\u2019t seem to get\nhis research approved. So, he bites the bullet and experiments on himself, and accidentally gives himself another personality.\n\nAnd another. And another.\n\nAs the death count rises, events spiral out of control and unlikely friends\nare made, can Jekyll work out a way to correct his mistake and get his life\nback on track, all while keeping the murderous Hyde, demanding Hilda and tumultuous Martin from driving him mad?\nToday might be a four sugar day.",

The play is set in Ezra's Atlantic Club in Soho during the summer of 1958. Silver Johnny, Ezra's seventeen-year-old rock 'n' roll prot\u00e9g\u00e9, is causing a sensation at the club. Two petty crooks, Sweets and Potts, high on amphetamines, introduce us to this criminal milieu. They are joined by two others, Skinny, and Baby, who is Ezra's son. Baby enjoys tormenting, even torturing, Skinny. While the youngsters mess about, a local gangster, Sam Ross, kills Ezra, and takes Silver Johnny. Terrified, the gang, now led by Mickey (Ezra's number two) barricade themselves in the club and prepare for an attack. Although he is Ezra's son and heir, Baby realises that Mickey is now in charge and suggests they run the club together, but Mickey rejects him. In the power struggle that ensues, Baby demonstrates that he's more than a match for Mickey \u2013 and nobody escapes unscathed.",

The couple are struggling to cope with the loss of their child especially during this festive season. The play takes place in 1950s England, a time where communication and expressing emotions was not a cultural priority. The standards of Mid-Century, post-war England furthers the couple\u2019s problems because they are not talking about their differing mourning processes or dealing with their grief together. The play is set over the course of a day from the morning of the 24th of December to midnight, when it officially becomes Christmas. Charlotte and Thomas are hosting a Christmas Eve meal for their friends: Nora and William. This joyous meal turns sour as the couple\u2019s underlying tension is finally brought to the surface.",

However, behind her fa\u00e7ade of the perfect entertainer and homemaker, she suffers from crippling depression which drives her to try and take her own life. The play follows the 24-hour aftermath of this event, in which we learn her reason for resorting to this form of escape and see her learn to live on another day. Discussing themes of depression, love and the mundanity of survival, this timeless classic leaves the audience with a sense of catharsis and bitter-sweet hope.",

When Charity, a woman infamous on earth, arrives at the court, the corruption of the system is truly revealed, as the women crowd around her to push for a fair trial.

Sometimes, our states of mind, trying, waiting, hoping, grieving, can become so all-consuming that they feel like actual, physical places which our minds inhabit. So, what if they were? Leia was sharp-witted , defiant, shameless. She was good. After her sudden passing, her friends and family are forced to come to terms with their changed realities and broken hearts. They find themselves in an abstract world within their imagination, wherein their states of mind are represented by a physical island. Throughout this comedy-drama, those, who knew and loved Leida Rhodes, must explore these strange, other-worldly islands in order to reach conclusions about their own emotional states, as they learn how adjusting to life after grief can be impossibly painful, yet surprisingly beautiful, all at once.",

        "body": "The Cherry Orchard is the last play by Russian playwright Anton Chekhov. Although Chekhov intended it as a comedy, and it does contain some elements of farce, Stanislavski insisted on directing the play as a tragedy. Since this initial production, directors have had to contend with the dual nature of the play. The play is often identified on the short list of the three or four outstanding plays written by Chekhov along with The Seagull, Three Sisters, and Uncle Vanya.\n\nThe play concerns an aristocratic Russian woman and her family as they return to their family estate (which includes a large and well-known cherry orchard) just before it is auctioned to pay the mortgage. While presented with options to save the estate, the family essentially does nothing and the play ends with the sale of the estate to the son of a former serf; the family leaves to the sound of the cherry orchard being cut down. The story presents themes of cultural futility\u201a both the futile attempts of the aristocracy to maintain its status and of the bourgeoisie to find meaning in its newfound materialism. In reflecting the socio-economic forces at work in Russia at the turn of the 20th century, including the rise of the middle class after the abolition of serfdom in the mid-19th century and the sinking of the aristocracy, the play reflects forces at work around the globe in that period.",

        "body": "The only play of Miller's not set in the present day, 'The Crucible' is in many ways the most universally and perennially topical of them all. Its concern is with singlemindedness that has become fanatacism, with religion that has either hardened into bigotry or degenerated into self-indulgence and hysteria, and with the inhumanity of man that has always haunted Miller's imagination. Its New England setting and its central warning - see what happens when men salve their consciences by transferring to higher authority their responsibility for moral decisions - seemed to give it perculiar relevance into the political situation in America when it was written (1953), but its implications are much wider. McCarthyism is not the only form of authoritanarianism to which Proctor's protest in this play might be directed: \"Is the accuser always holy now?\"; nor was seventeenth-century Salem the only community in which all normal, rational evidence has been for a time either high-handedly disregarded or high-mindedly misinterpreted.",

It was written in 1881 and first staged in 1882 in Chicago, Illinois, in a production by a Danish company on tour. Like many of Ibsen's plays, Ghosts is a scathing commentary on 19th-century morality. Because of its subject matter, which includes religion, venereal disease, incest and euthanasia, it immediately generated strong controversy and negative criticism. Since then the play has fared better, and is considered a \u201cgreat play\u201d that historically holds a position of \u201cimmense importance\u201d.",

Like John Bunyan's 1678 Christian novel The Pilgrim's Progress, Everyman uses allegorical characters to examine the question of Christian salvation and what Man must do to attain it. The premise is that the good and evil deeds of one's life will be tallied by God after death, as in a ledger book. The play is the allegorical accounting of the life of Everyman, who represents all mankind. In the course of the action, Everyman tries to convince other characters to accompany him in the hope of improving his account. All the characters are also allegorical, each personifying an abstract idea such as Fellowship, (material) Goods, and Knowledge. The conflict between good and evil is dramatised by the interactions between characters. Everyman is being singled out because it is difficult for him to find characters to accompany him on his pilgrimage. Everyman eventually realizes through this pilgrimage that he is essentially alone, despite all the personified characters that were supposed necessities and friends to him. Everyman learns that when you are brought to death and placed before God all you are left with is your own good deeds.",

Disease, drunkeness and disorder flourish, and faced with the neccessity of enforcing firm discipline, the Duke abdicates his authority to Angelo, who, to the dismay of such hardened practitioners as Pompey and Mistress Overdone, enfroces his own particular brand of prohiition...\n\nWritten after the theatres re-opened subsequent to the plague of 1603, it was first performed in the year 1604 as witness the Revels Accounts which list a productions of 'Mesur for Mesur' by Shaxberd in the Whitehall banqueting house on St. Stephen's Night. This places the play between Othello and King Lear which may be relevant to it being classified as a 'dark comedy'; that is, a happy ending but brought about by a series of events of dubious moral standing and ethical content.\n\nReferances topical to Shakespeare's audience do occur quite frequently, and although these allusions are likely to be lost on present day theatre-goers, there is much which is still very relevant today. The interaction and conflict between authority and power, duty and honour are themes that only change with human nature.",

In a world of stereotypes and attitudes (men do this, women are like that; feminine reaction, masculine response) She is society's product if not victim. All reduction of people to objects, all imposition of labels and patterns to which they must conform, all segregation can lead only to destruction. In the very moment when the women have got their own back on men for their type-casting in an orgasm of violence they find they have destroyed themselves and in death there is certainly no difference.",

It was based on The Boy Hairdresser, a novel by Orton and his lover Kenneth Halliwell. The title and play are based on a few lines from poet and dramatist William Ernest Henley: \"Madam Life's a piece in bloom, \/ Death goes dogging everywhere: \/ She's the tenant of the room, \/ He's the ruffian on the stair.\" Ruffian is not as renowned as other works such as Loot and What the Butler Saw, but it is still staged on occasion.",

The play begins with a mutual vow reminiscent of the vow beginning the play Lysistrata in which Greek women vow to deny men sex to protest the Peloponnesian War. The three women teachers mutually pledge to abstain from sexual intercourse, in protest against the dominance and abusive treatment of women by men, epitomized in the slur against women as \"slags.\" Conflicts among the teachers' different visions of radical feminism, different motivations, and different interpretations of and commitment to the vow become the grist for duplicitous dominant and abusive acts among them and distracts them from their teaching. Dominance and Feminism are ridiculed alike, while the number of pupils dwindles to zero in the resulting dysfunctional environment, leaving the three teachers to go their separate ways.\n\nSlag was a breakthrough play for David Hare. Reputedly written by Hare in three days time, working out of the back of a van, it won for him the Evening Standard (London) Award for most promising new playwright and launched his prolific and successful career as a playwright.",

Late one evening, after a university faculty party, they receive an unwitting younger couple, Nick and Honey, as guests, and draw them into their bitter and frustrated relationship. The play is in three acts, normally taking a little less than three hours to perform, with two 10-minute intermissions. The title is a pun on the song \"Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?\" from Walt Disney's Three Little Pigs (1933), substituting the name of the celebrated English author Virginia Woolf. Martha and George repeatedly sing this version of the song throughout the play.",

        "body": "The Country Wife is a Restoration comedy written in 1675 by William Wycherley. A product of the tolerant early Restoration period, the play reflects an aristocratic and anti-Puritan ideology, and was controversial for its sexual explicitness even in its own time. The title itself contains a lewd pun. It is based on several plays by Moli\u00e8re, with added features that 1670s London audiences demanded: colloquial prose dialogue in place of Moli\u00e8re's verse, a complicated, fast-paced plot tangle, and many sex jokes. It turns on two indelicate plot devices: a rake's trick of pretending impotence to safely have clandestine affairs with married women, and the arrival in London of an inexperienced young \"country wife\", with her discovery of the joys of town life, especially the fascinating London men.\n\nThe scandalous trick and the frank language have for much of the play's history kept it off the stage and out of print. Between 1753 and 1924, The Country Wife was considered too outrageous to be performed at all and was replaced on the stage by David Garrick's cleaned-up and bland version The Country Girl, now a forgotten curiosity. The original play is again a stage favourite today, and is also acclaimed by academic critics, who praise its linguistic energy, sharp social satire, and openness to different interpretations.",

It was revised in 1960 to include an epilogue, or afterpiece.\n\nThis dark comedy is set in a town that is being regularly attacked by arsonists. Disguised as door-to-door salesmen (hawkers), they talk their way into people's homes and settle down in the attic, where they set about the destruction of the house. Written in the years following World War II, as a metaphor for Nazism and fascism, the play shows how \"normal\" citizens can be taken in by evil.",

As the design students had limited chances to see their designs actually constructed, Jenny had the great idea of getting real world experience with us. For many years afterwards I had her art deco design sketches which I later returned to her when she was working at the Theatre Royal Stratford East. That might have been the night I was offered a drink in the bar by David Calder - \u2018theatrical royalty\u2019? The design required the band to be on stage and we came up with the idea, with Mike Wolfe the Lighting Designer, to hide the band behind a sharkstooth gauze during the overture. The idea was to snap the band into view at the start of Act One. This meant we needed Jenny\u2019s art deco view of London painted identically on both the gauze and a back cloth. I had no idea of how to do that so I asked my friend Stanley Rixon, Technical Manager of my home theatre, The Nuffield Southampton, for advice. He said just bring everything down to Southampton and he would do it. So one Saturday I drove with the gauze, the backcloth and Jenny\u2019s design sketches to Southampton. Stanley always painted at night, he said he saw the colours better. He layed out the backcloth on the Nuffield stage, with the gauze on top of it, and painted both at the same time. Once hung in the New Theatre about 7 feet apart and with the band squeezed in between I think we managed an \u201coooh\u201d from the audience each night when the band suddenly appeared in a snap cue.",

A few minutes into the show there is a short circuit, and the stage is illuminated to reveal the characters in a \"blackout.\" On the few occasions when matches, lighters, or torches are lit, the lights grow dimmer. The title of the play is a pun.\n\nBrindsley Miller, a young sculptor, and his debutante fianc\u00e9e Carol Melkett have borrowed some expensive, antique furniture from his neighbor Harold's flat without his permission in order to impress an elderly millionaire art collector coming to view Brindsley's work, and Carol's father Colonel Melkett. When the power fails, Harold returns early, and Brindsley's ex-mistress Clea shows up unexpectedly, things slide into disaster for him.",

The entire story plays out in the officers' dugout over four days from 18 March 1918 to 21 March 1918, during the run-up to the real-life events of Operation Michael.\n\nSherriff considered calling it \"Suspense\" and \"Waiting\", but eventually found a title in the closing line of a chapter of an unidentified book: \"It was late in the evening when we came at last to our journey's end.\"",

        "body": "> And now The Possessed has reached the stage after several years of labour and persistence. And yet I am well aware of all that separates the play from that amazing novel! I merely tried to follow the book's undercurrent and to proceed as it does from satiric comedy to drama and then to tragedy. Both the original and the dramatic adaptation start from a certain realism and end up in tragic stylizations. As for the rest, I tried, amidst this cast, preposterous, panting world full of outbursts and scenes of violence, never to lose the threadof suffering and affection that markes Dostoyevsky's universe so close to each of us. Dostoyevsky's characters, as we all know well by now, are neither odd nor absurd. They are like us; we have the same heart. And if The Possessed is a prophetic book, this is not only because it prefigures our nihilism, but also because its protagonists are torn or dead souls unable to love and suffering from that inability, wanting to believe and yet unable to do so - like those who people our society and our spiritual world today. The subject of this work is just as much the murder of Shatov (inspired by a real event - the assassination of the student Ivanov by the nihilist Nechayev) as the spiritual adventures of Stavrogin, a contemporary hero. Hence I have dramatized not only one of the masterpieces of world literature but also a work of current application.\n\n\\- Albert Camus",

They persuade the Queen to summon Iolanthe and forgive her. On her arrival she reveals that she has a son who is half a fairy - his legs are mortal. Strephon, who now enters, tells his mother and his 'aunts' that he is anxious to marry Phyllis, a Ward of Chancery, but is prevented by the Lord Chancellor. The Fairy Queen promises Strephon any help he wishes. After Strephon and Phyllis sing of their love for each other the Peers enter with 'Loudly Let the Trumpet Bray'. The Lord Chancellor still holds his consent to the marriage between Strephon and Phyllis. Strephon, in despair, consults his mother, but Phyllis (seeing him with a young woman) assumes he is being unfaithful. He calls to the Fairy Queen for help and Act I ends with her and the fairies telling the Peers that Strephon can go into Parliament and wreak havoc there.\nAt the start of Act II, Private Willis, on guard at Westminster, meditates on the political scene. At a second meeting between Phyllis and Strephon, in which Strephon manages to explain his situation, the are reunited and ask Iolanthe to intercede for them with the Lord Chancellor. She does, although if she goe to him and is recognised, she will be condemned to death. Why? - well, we'd hate to spoil the story for you!",

First performed on 14 February 1895 at the St James's Theatre in London, it is a farcical comedy in which the protagonists maintain fictitious person\u00e6 to escape burdensome social obligations. Working within the social conventions of late Victorian London, the play's major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage, and the resulting satire of Victorian ways. Contemporary reviews all praised the play's humour, though some were cautious about its explicit lack of social messages, while others foresaw the modern consensus that it was the culmination of Wilde's artistic career so far. Its high farce and witty dialogue have helped make The Importance of Being Earnest Wilde's most enduringly popular play",

The play portrays More as a man of principle, envied by rivals such as Thomas Cromwell and loved by the common people and by his family.",

        "body": "Set in Victorian London, the play focuses on Macheath, an amoral, antiheroic criminal.\n\nMacheath (\"Mackie\", or \"Mack the Knife\") marries Polly Peachum. This displeases her father, who controls the beggars of London, and he endeavours to have Macheath hanged. His attempts are hindered by the fact that the Chief of Police, Tiger Brown, is Macheath's old army comrade. Still, Peachum exerts his influence and eventually gets Macheath arrested and sentenced to hang. Macheath escapes this fate via a deus ex machina moments before the execution when, in an unrestrained parody of a happy ending, a messenger from the Queen arrives to pardon Macheath and grant him the title of Baron.",

The idea for it came in 1970, when Frayn was watching from the wings a performance of The Two of Us, a farce that he had written for Lynn Redgrave. He said, \"It was funnier from behind than in front, and I thought that one day I must write a farce from behind.\" The prototype, a short-lived one-act play called Exits, was written and performed in 1977. At the request of his associate, Michael Codron, Frayn expanded this into what would become Noises Off. It takes its title from the theatrical stage direction indicating sounds coming from offstage.",

Pinelli was killed when he \"fell\" from the fourth floor window of the police interrogation room. The militant left-wing newspaper, Lotta Continua, was not slow to accuse Calabresi, the police inspector in charge, of the \"murder\" of Pinelli.\n\nThese are the facts on which Fo's play was based in 1970. Fo had been quick to see the enormous dramatic potential of this real-life farce and to turn it to political advantage.",

He conjures up a storm, the eponymous tempest, to lure his usurping brother Antonio and the complicit King Alonso of Naples to the island. There, his machinations bring about the revelation of Antonio's lowly nature, the redemption of the King, and the marriage of Miranda to Alonso's son, Ferdinand.",

The play centres on the twins Viola and Sebastian, who are separated in a shipwreck. Viola (who is disguised as a boy) falls in love with Duke Orsino, who in turn is in love with the Countess Olivia. Upon meeting Viola, Countess Olivia falls in love with her thinking she is a man. The play expanded on the musical interludes and riotous disorder expected of the occasion, with plot elements drawn from the short story \"Of Apollonius and Silla\" by Barnabe Rich, based on a story by Matteo Bandello. The first recorded performance was on 2 February 1602, at Candlemas, the formal end of Christmastide in the year's calendar. The play was not published until its inclusion in the 1623 First Folio.",

Drawing upon their past experience and talents, which included numerous plays, musicals, radio productions and comedy revues, the team first hit the stage in February 1997. It was this comedy show, performed and broadcast from a packed union bar, which threw the first snowball of success that, unbeknown to us, was soon to become an avalanche.\n\n'We Should Get Out More\u2019s popularity with a student audience resulted in the formation of an award-winning radio comedy programme, broadcast twice weekly throughout Nottingham. Since these early days, the show has gone from strength to strength, broadcasting popular weekly shows across Nottingham and supplementing these with regular productions in the university\u2019s theatre. The entirely original material was judged by the BBC as \"Best Student Entertainment Programme 1997\", and then, again, in 1998, \"Best Student Entertainment Programme 1998\".\n\nFollowing a 2-week tour around Nottingham, 'We Should Get Out More' hit Edinburgh. The show was a runaway success at the 1998 Edinburgh Festival, pulling in capacity crowds and also picking up an award from 'The Scotsman'.",
